WHAT IS BLIS?
=============

Blis is one of the libraries that make up the Cops (COIN Open Parallel Search
Framework) library hierarchy. It is a solver for mixed integer linear programs
(MILPs) built on top of the two other libraries in the hierarchy, Bcps and
Alps. Blis has most of the features of a modern MILP solver, but can take
advantage of the ability of Alps and Bcps to run in parallel. It can be easily
customized for special problem classes.
